Sequences
=========

The :mini:`for`-loop in *Minilang* works with any value that can generate successive pairs of *keys* and *values*. Examples include strings, ranges, lists and maps. In some cases such as strings, ranges and lists, the keys will simply be the natural numbers, :mini:`1`, :mini:`2`, ..., etc. In other cases such as maps, the keys can be general values.

.. code-block:: mini

   for K, V in ["A", "B", "C"] do
      print('{K} -> {V}\n')
   end

   for K, V in 10 .. 12 do
      print('{K} -> {V}\n')
   end

   for K, V in "cat" do
      print('{K} -> {V}\n')
   end

   for K, V in {"a" is 1, "b" is 2, "c" is 3} do
      print('{K} -> {V}\n')
   end

.. code-block:: console

   1 -> A
   2 -> B
   3 -> C

   1 -> 10
   2 -> 11
   3 -> 12

   1 -> c
   2 -> a
   3 -> t

   a -> 1
   b -> 2
   c -> 3

Functions on Sequences
----------------------

As well as iterating over a sequence with :mini:`for`-loop, *Minilang* provides a number of functions for working with sequences.

:mini:`count(Sequence)` returns the number of values generated by :mini:`Sequence`. :mini:`count` is defined simply as the method :mini:`:count`. The default implementation generates all the values from the sequence and counts but some sequence types (e.g. lists, maps, etc) can have more efficient implementations that don't require generating all the values.

:mini:`list(Sequence)` collects all the values generated by :mini:`Sequence` into a new list.

:mini:`map(Sequence)` collects all the keys and values generated by :mini:`Sequence` into a new map. Duplicate keys are replaced since maps only store one value per key.

.. code-block:: mini

   let C := count("cat")
   let L := list("cat")
   let M := map("cat")

   print('C = {C}\n')
   print('L = {L}\n')
   print('M = {M}\n')

.. code-block:: console

   C = 3
   L = [c, a, t]
   M = {1 is c, 2 is a, 3 is t}

Chaining Sequences
------------------

Given an initial sequence, it is possible to create a new sequence by modifying the keys and/or values of the initial sequence, or by filtering out key-value pairs that satisfy a particular condition. There are a number of operators for doing this in *Minilang*:

.. code-block:: mini

   list("cat" -> :upper)
   
   fun is_consonant(L) not {"a", "e", "i", "o", "u"}[L:lower]
   
   list("cat" ->? is_consonant)

.. code-block:: console

   [C, A, T]
   [c, t]

Generating Functions
--------------------

Functions can behave as sequences by using the :mini:`susp` keyword to generate a value or key-value pair.

.. code-block:: mini

   fun test(var N) do
      loop
         susp N
         if N = 1 then
            ret nil
         elseif 2 | N then
            N := old / 2
         else
            N := 3 * old + 1
         end
      end
   end

   for N in 1 .. 20 do
      print('{N} -> {list(test(N))}\n')
   end

.. code-block:: console

   1 -> [1]
   2 -> [2, 1]
   3 -> [3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
   4 -> [4, 2, 1]
   5 -> [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
   6 -> [6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
   7 -> [7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
   8 -> [8, 4, 2, 1]
   9 -> [9, 28, 14, 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
   10 -> [10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
   11 -> [11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
   12 -> [12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
   13 -> [13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
   14 -> [14, 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
   15 -> [15, 46, 23, 70, 35, 106, 53, 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
   16 -> [16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
   17 -> [17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
   18 -> [18, 9, 28, 14, 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
   19 -> [19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
   20 -> [20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]

The :mini:`susp` keyword generates a key and value from a *Minilang* function. The function must return :mini:`nil` when it has no more values to produce. A key can be omitted, in which case :mini:`nil` is used as the key.
